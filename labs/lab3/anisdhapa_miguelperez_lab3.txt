3. it does not do anything with y because we did not declare value of y yet.
6. it is not showing any picture because we did not use any method to draw robot.
9. it moves the robot by its width pixel to x direction(right).

2. we compile the code to check it works.
5. The robot is at 2*width now.
6. It's not showing anything.
8. The robot is now 5 units right and 5 units down.
9. i would move robot -5 units horizontally  and -5 units vertically.

1. this method is accessor because it doesnt change original variable or value.
2. 610 pixel
5. 2 units 
6. moveHorizontaly and we already update it by x = unit + x : 
8. put value in movevertical method and check we get the same value in getY() method.

2. it shows the robot with moved 2units right and print 2 and Expected:2
4. it shows robot disappear and we got value -2 for ya and 2 for x.
5. they are 
6. we change public int getX() to public int getWidth() and return x to return width.
7. everthing stay exact same way it was.
9. we do not need these variable any longer.yes they can not eliminated beacause we still need it for other method.
10. since we don't need to elimiated x and y. they run in pixles.
11.we do not need to re-run

1. use moveHOrizontally method
2. robot 
4. I added a test case to the MoveTester class.
6. pic.translate();
