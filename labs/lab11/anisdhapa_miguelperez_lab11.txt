part A
2.array 
3.int[] twoArray = new int[];
4.finding even and 
finding odd and 
counting
5.  Element Separators
6.  int[] s = new int[2];
        int oddcounter = 0;
        int evencouner = 0; 
 s[0] = evencouner ;
       s[1] = oddcounter;
        return s;
7.if (values[i] % 2 == 0)
            {
                evencouner++;
            }else
            {
                 oddcounter++;
            }
part B 
1. go to all element in arrray and find the duplicates and remove the duplicates and get the orginal word without duplicates 
2. yes we passed all tests
3. yes we did pass all tests.

part c 
2. we decided to add new variable which hold the old number and we assign that number to swap number and it works.
part d
2.use the for loop which goes until the length of arraylist 
take the first element and move it to last place 
4. use the for loop which goes to length/2
save the picture i in new variable and set the i as i + length/2 
at the end set the i+ length/2 variable as new variable.
